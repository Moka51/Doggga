                  This is the story of DOGGGO, an ugly, poor and bastard dog
                  forgotten by crypto community. DOGGGO always tried to be
                  recognized by his fellas (SHIB, DOGE and AKITA) but because
                  its not a pure race dog they never wanted to accept him.
                  DOGGGO has always been different from them, he started from
                  the streets, where he belong to. He used to eat what he could
                  find around and sleep wherever he could find a place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  DOGGGO never forgot his origins, he knows what poor means and
                  his mission is now to help his community to get out of this
                  condition.

                  DOGGGO becomes a bit popular and he is very happy. Some people
                  discovered him and found him cute. There is only 1 problem.
                  People are scared to buy $DGGG cause website and domain seems
                  scammy. DOGGGO knows it and he studied a bit HTML in the
                  nighttime and found some business angels to help him update
                  website and domain.
                </p>
                <p>Now all is safe with a .io and a SSL protected webiste.</p>

                  DOGGGO popularity is growing a bit but the market is not
                  helping him. All crashed and DOGGGO has not enough money to
                  continue. During the day he found job at MacDonalds but even
                  after 20 hours work a day he get just the money to survive.
                </p>
                <p>Now all is safe with a .io and a SSL protected webiste.</p>

                <p>
                  DOGGGO is very sad but during a night he had an idea. What
                  about ask at the community a contribution to reach the mooon?
                  DOGGGO created the “DOGGGO MOON WALLET” to raise funds for
                  importat and expensive ads campaigns. He dream every night to
                  be shilled by WSB and be friend by all degens/apes of the
                  crypto market.

                  DOGGGO’s community is growing and some members are spending
                  time to create DOGGGO’s gadgets. DOGGGO is very happy to see
                  that and he had an amazing idea. What about give at the
                  community the possibility to sell them gadgets to the world?
                  DOGGGO is very attached to his community and wants to help
                  them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For that reason he opened an amazing “community driven
                  marketplace” (more similar a bazaar :D).

                  Crypto market dumped some weeks ago and DOGGGO also got poor
                  again :(
                </p>
                <p>
                  During this period DOGGGO had time to think how to relaunch
                  his image for the next bull run. What about a new smart
                  contract, new website and an amazing dapp for farming and
                  staking? DOGGGO contacted some friends to help him at build it
                  and after few weeks the dream came true.
                </p>
                <img src="images/article/7.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>
                  It was very very happy and as soon as he completed the jobs he
                  launched it (not much testing testing on code). Result???
                  Contract autorugpull (the first in crypto world).
                </p>
                <img src="images/article/8.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>
                  That's was not nice and DOGGGO lost 24 BNB in that fucking
                  contract. The day after he fixed it and asked some money at
                  the mafia to launch it again. Hope DOGGGO could give back that
                  money to them or they kill him :'(
                </p>
                <img src="images/article/9.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>
                  In any case new DOGGGO is live and fully working... hope this
                  contract not rugpull again.
